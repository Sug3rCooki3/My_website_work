## 🏗 How to Use These Documents

### For the Developer (You)
1.  **Read First:** Before writing code for a section, read the corresponding document.
2.  **Checklist:** Treat the headers in these files as a checklist. Have you implemented the "Scarcity" element? Is the "Calendly" widget in the right place?
3.  **Reference:** When stuck on a design decision (e.g., "What font should I use?"), refer back to `03_Design_Style_Site.md` or `01_Strategic_Elements.md`.

### Benefits
*   **Clarity:** Removes ambiguity about *what* to build.
*   **Speed:** Coding is faster when the thinking/planning is already done.
*   **Quality:** Ensures the final product isn't just "pretty" but is strategically sound and effective.
*   **Reduced Rework:** Prevents building features that don't align with the core goals.
