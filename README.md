# IS117 Final Project Portfolio

Welcome to my final project portfolio for IS117. This repository houses a collection of three distinct web development projects, showcased through a central landing page designed with a modern Neumorphism aesthetic.

## Projects Overview

This portfolio demonstrates versatility in web design and development through three unique implementations:

1.  **Portfolio Site**
    *   **Theme**: AI Product Engineer Portfolio.
    *   **Design Style**: Swiss International Style.
    *   **Description**: A clean, grid-based portfolio highlighting professional work and skills in AI engineering.

2.  **Design Style Site**
    *   **Theme**: Educational Museum Piece.
    *   **Design Style**: International Typographic Style.
    *   **Description**: An educational site exploring the history and principles of the International Typographic Style (Swiss Style).

3.  **Client Site**
    *   **Theme**: GreenLeaf Landscaping.
    *   **Design Style**: Business/Sales Funnel.
    *   **Description**: A commercial website designed for a landscaping business, featuring an integrated sales funnel to convert visitors into clients.

## Landing Page Design

The main entry point (`docs/index.html`) features a **Neumorphism (Soft UI)** design language. Key characteristics include:
*   **Soft Shadows**: Creating depth and a tactile feel.
*   **Monochromatic Color Scheme**: Using a soft gray-blue palette (`#e0e5ec`).
*   **Interactive Elements**: Buttons and cards that appear to be extruded from the background, with realistic pressed states and ripple effects on interaction.
